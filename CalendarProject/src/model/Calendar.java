/*Our calendar is fairly simple: it has one constructor that takes a Date, which it sets as the current Date; it has one email that
        it’s associated with; it has getters for those fields; and it can add or remove Entries. You will definitely want at least one
        getter that returns every item in the collection. You may also want to add getters that return the soonest Entry, that return Entries
        by name, or that return only Meetings… this is up to you, and it depends on how you want to use
        your Calendar. You can always start with a simple specification and then expand your functionality once you get the type hierarchy working.*/
